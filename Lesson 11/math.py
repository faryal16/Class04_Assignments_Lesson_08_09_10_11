print("""\n Explanation of Methods:
math.sqrt(num): Calculates the square root of num. For example, the square root of 16 is 4.

math.factorial(num): Calculates the factorial of a number (e.g., 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120).

math.pow(base, exponent): Raises base to the power of exponent (e.g., 2^3 = 8).

math.pi: Returns the constant value of Ï€ (approximately 3.141592653589793).

math.radians(degrees): Converts an angle from degrees to radians (necessary for trigonometric functions like math.cos).

math.cos(radians): Calculates the cosine of an angle (provided in radians).

round(num): Rounds a floating-point number to the nearest integer.""")
